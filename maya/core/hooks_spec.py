"""
This module defines the `HooksSpec` class, which provides default lifecycle hooks
for various operations in a web application using the Starlette framework.

These hooks are designed to be optionally overridden in custom implementations to
intercept and modify application behavior at key points such as route initialization,
response generation, login handling, autocomplete queries, context building,
record retrieval, search operations, and resource fetching.

Each method provides a structured point of extension to alter or augment the
underlying process and its data without modifying core logic, enabling flexible
customization.

Key features include:
- Modifying routes after initialization (`after_routes_init`)
- Customizing responses before they are returned (`before_response`)
- Adjusting login success/failure data (`after_login_success`, `after_login_failure`)
- Enhancing autocomplete and search behavior
(`before_get_auto_complete`, `after_get_auto_complete`, `before_get_search`, `after_get_search`)
- Modifying context data (`before_context`)
- Intercepting record retrieval logic (`after_get_record`, `after_get_record_and_types`)
- Transforming resource output from external APIs (`after_get_resource`)
