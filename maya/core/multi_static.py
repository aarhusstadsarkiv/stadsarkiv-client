"""
This module defines the `MultiStaticFiles` class, a subclass of Starlette's `StaticFiles`,
that enables serving static files from multiple directories simultaneously.

By default, Starlette's `StaticFiles` class supports a single directory or package for static assets.
This enhancement addresses the limitation by allowing a list of directories to be registered,
providing a simple mechanism for serving files from multiple sources.
